### This is an unofficial add-on mod for the [Vault Hunters 3rd Edition](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/vault-hunters-1-18-2) modpack

Do you have trouble navigating the vaults and often get lost? Are you tired of having to remember the exact path you took in a vault? This mod is for you!

This mod adds an on-screen minimap showing all the rooms you have explored in the vault you're currently in as well as all special rooms added by using inscriptions on your vault crystal. Plus, there are even more features that we are planning to add in the future.

The mod is currently fully client-sided, however you should get permission from server admins and other players before using it on a server.
