todo:

find a way to grab which direction the vault is facing
grab the inscription data from the hologram block and display it
somehow show room types (mining, omega, etc) in the map
lock the map behind a research or something (>"If this is implemented, it will probably need a research beyond Vault Compass, and a crafting item that is significantly more expensive (costing a couple POGs probably)") // boolean hasCompassResearch = StageManager.getResearchTree(Minecraft.getInstance().player).getResearchesDone().contains("Vault Compass");
detect edges of the vault and show them in the map
add a way to sync map data between players
"Or maybe use the vault compass? The same way as how holding right click on the compass changes where it points to, if the vault compass points to a room that isnâ€™t the start then the minimap points to that room"
"Waypoint support would still be cool, like waypoints displaying on ur map or rooms changing color if a waypoint is in there"

find out wtf "cut rooms" are
